# masd-goal

## TODOs

#### undone


1. prepare documentation
-write some text about the process
2. start coding(demo)
-critical feedback on how we translated one part of our idea into goal-code(via modelling)
3. prepare presentation
-slides from documentation
4. how to connect scenarios to goals?
5. how to connect scenarios to agents?

#### modelling decisions(to adjust to a problem)
a. fully automated restaurant(only robots)
b. partially automated restaurant(screens and task for humans, supportive system)

####done
- fix modelling problem in eclipse(that the diagrams are not shown and the palette neither) and adjust
- alternativly: get another modelling tool running on macos

## Git and Eclipse

## Design Tool evaluation

- shitty to install!
+++ the professor wants/loves it

draw.io
+gdrive support
-browers-usage
-no style-support?
+version-control


## Eclipse plugin

Steps for installing this Prometheus Modelling Tool plug-in on Eclipse:

Download and uncompress the PDT-Plugin-v0.5.1.zip file
Copy the jar files to:
Eclipseâ€™s plug-ins folder (Windows / Linux)
Folder: [EclipseInstallationFolder]/Eclipse.app/Contents/Eclipse/dropins (Mac OS)

Open MASD.pd in eclipse.
To draw, you have to open the pallete by clicking on the arrow on top of the scroll bar.(very hidden!!!1!)

# Delivery-Dates
6.6. Wednesday: Documentation by mail
7.6. : Presentation-Slides
8.6. : Presentation with Demo


# Second delivery requirements

In all cases you should cover the following aspects:

A. (Updated) description of the Agent framework.

It is usual that, after having some experience with the language/framework, you will have a better understanding about it, and things that were unclear during the writing of the first assignment are now clearer. So here you should provide an updated/improved version of the original document you submitted for the first assignment, one that can be useful for your classmates to really understand all its elements.

B. Own analysis of the agent language/platform chosen

After having experienced a bit of programming in 2APL / Jason / GOAL /JADEx, what is your own analysis? Have you found it more difficult/easy than expected? Which are the strong points? And the weak points?. Is there something you wanted to implement that could not be handled by the language, the platform or the tools?


C. Description of the problem to solve

Carefully describe the scenario that you want to solve, and explain which are the issues/characteristics that make Multiagents a suitable solution for it.


D. Multiagent design

Design your multiagent system using an Agent-oriented methodology (GAIA, Prometheus or any other existing, of your choice). The diagrams of concepts, roles, agents... should be part of your documentation. You should also explain in the report your design decisions (e.g., why grouping these functionalities or roles in Agent X).


E. Prototype

Describe the prototype you have built. Does it cover all the scenario as described in C? Which parts of the scenario are not implemented?

(you will have to do a demo to the rest of the students on June 8)

## Diagram Descriptions(WIP)

Analysis Overview:
- we wanted to model basically goals, scenarios, agents, actors(human) and roles
- Challenges:
- agents cant connect to scenarios
- scenarios cant connect to goals
- Solutions:

Goal Overview:
- show dependencies of the goals.
- not completly sure about the root-goal
- could be more fine-granular
